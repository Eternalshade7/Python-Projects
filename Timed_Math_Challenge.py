# Run the challenge
math_challenge(duration=30)
# This code implements a timed math challenge where the user has to solve as many math problems as possible within a given time limit.
# The user is presented with random math questions, and their score is calculated based on the number of correct answers.
# The game ends when the time is up, and the user is shown their score.
